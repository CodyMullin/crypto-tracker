# Crypto Tracker

Check the live project here: https://crypto-tracker-ivory.vercel.app/

This project was built using React and TailwindCSS as a way to practice getting data from an external source: Coinstats

Includes features such as search and filter by number of coins. I went ahead and allowed a user to search for 10, 25, 50, 75, or 100 coins.
